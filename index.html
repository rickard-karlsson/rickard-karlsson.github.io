    <p>This is some introduction text.</p>

    <p>Talent is a pursued interest. That is to say, anything you practice you can do. We'll put some happy little leaves here and there. Use what you see, don't plan it.</p>

    <p>We need dark in order to show light. I can't think of anything more rewarding than being able to express yourself to others through painting. You got your heavy coat out yet? It's getting colder. The little tiny Tim easels will let you down. I'm going to mix up a little color. Weâ€™ll use Van Dyke Brown, Permanent Red, and a little bit of Prussian Blue.</p>

    <p>But they're very easily killed. Clouds are delicate. Use your imagination, let it go. We have a fantastic little sky! If I paint something, I don't want to have to explain what it is.</p>

    <p>Use what happens naturally, don't fight it. That's a crooked tree. We'll send him to Washington. Maybe there's a little something happening right here.</p>

    <p>We tell people sometimes: we're like drug dealers, come into town and get everybody absolutely addicted to painting. It doesn't take much to get you addicted. We don't really know where this goes - and I'm not sure we really care. If you don't think every day is a good day - try missing a few. You'll see. A fan brush can be your best friend.</p>

    <p>You want your tree to have some character. Make it special. Fluff it up a little and hypnotize it. All you need is a dream in your heart, and an almighty knife. This is probably the greatest thing to happen in my life - to be able to share this with you.</p>

    <p>Let's make a happy little mountain now. Work that paint. In your imagination you can go anywhere you want.</p>
